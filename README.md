# Custom Add Another

This is a very simple module that allows you to customize the text of the 'Add 
another item' button on multi-valued fields. For example, if you have an image
field that allows multiple values, you may wish for the button to say "Add
another image" instead of "Add another item".

If your field supports 'unlimited' values then you are offered the option of 
customizing the 'Add another item' button text. This setting is stored per 
'bundle', so you can have different button text if you use the same field in 
two places.

## Installation

- Install this module using the official 
  [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)

## Usage

When editing a field that has 'Unlimited' values, an extra textfield will appear 
in the 'BUNDLE settings' fieldset that allows you to specify the custom button 
text. (e.g. for the 'page' content type, it will be in the 'Page settings' 
fieldset when editing the field's options)
